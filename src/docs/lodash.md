## Description
Lodash is a JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras that helps programmers write more concise and easier to maintain JavaScript.

It can be broken down into several main areas:

* Utilities - for simplifying common programming tasks such as determining type as well as simplifying math operations.
* Function - simplifying binding, decorating, constraining, throttling, debouncing, currying, and changing the pointer.
* String - conversion functions for performing basic string operations, such as trimming, converting to uppercase, camel case, etc.
* Array - creating, splitting, combining, modifying, and compressing
* Collection - iterating, sorting, filtering, splitting, and building
* Object - accessing, extending, merging, defaults, and transforming
* Seq - chaining, wrapping, filtering, and testing.

It has had multiple releases, so all functions may not be available in all implementations. For example, _.chunk has only been available since version 3.0.0.

``` js
_.defaults({ 'a': 1 }, { 'a': 3, 'b': 2 });
// → { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
_.partition([1, 2, 3, 4], n => n % 2);
// → [[1, 3], [2, 4]]
```
