## Description
Stencil was created by the Ionic Framework team to help build faster, more capable components that worked 
across all major frameworks.
It is a compiler that generates Web Components (more specifically, Custom Elements).
Stencil takes features such as
* Virtual DOM
* Async rendering (inspired by React Fiber)
* Reactive data-binding
* TypeScript
* JSX
and then generates standards-based Web Components with these features baked in.
